Executive summary: 
  
How the application works:  
You would input an age, and it would generate a famous person who died at that age of which you have entered, depending on the range the age falls into. It is a fun and innovative way to learn about different historical figures. 
  
With this application you can explore the ages at which famous figures passed away. Students can gain a deeper understanding of history and the impact these individuals had on the world.  
It is a great tool for both learning and sparking curiosity. 
  
Introduction: 
  
In this digital age, educational apps have become more popular since they are used for both entertainment and research purposes. In this instance, my History Application would stand out as a unique tool. By generating historical figures who have died within a specific age range, the application will create an engaging way for students to explore and learn about different influential individuals and what they have done to contribute to society. 
Throughout this report, we will investigate the app’s functionality, flagging its user-friendly interface, interactive features, and educational value, along with the work, coding and research put into the creation of the application. 
  
Methodology: 
  
In terms of approaching and understanding this project, I made myself familiar with the requirements and implemented a multi-step approach. 
⦁	Understanding the requirements: My method of determining what was required for the project is to go through our project document file and make two lists of the important aspects that I needed. One is a to-do list, so I know what I need to do, and the other is a list of potential approaches and answers. 
 
 
 
  
⦁	Research: To conduct research for the project, I first defined an age range that would be used in the code; next, I searched for persons who died at that age. The age range was set between twenty and one hundred, but there was also a subrange that produced a new individual every five years, then every four years, with each division falling between multiples of ten. Example: 30-35; 36-39. 
 
I also looked back at previous class activities and the module manual to figure out how I was going to write code for this project. 
  
⦁	Implementation: After gathering the necessary information, I began creating my user interface, which required to attract students' attention while also having a cause and making sense for its appearance. It would also need to be simple to use. I searched for backdrop images, colour themes, and hex codes, then formatted the project to match the sample provided in the project manual. 
 
I began coding with the declarations and worked on the generate button. I opted to use the reset/clear button. All the while, I was progressively committing new parts of the code to GitHub. 
  
  
Findings and data analysis: 
  
While conducting my study, I discovered that I needed to look for famous people who died at various ages, each of which fall within a specified age range. In total, I added sixteen people to my project. Which are: 
⦁	Aaliyah, an actor, and singer. Who died at the age of 22. (abcNews, 2008) 
⦁	Avicii, a record producer, Dj, and song writer. He died at the age of 28. (Louisa Ballhaus, Allysa K. Davis, Delilah Grey, 2023) 
⦁	Princess Diana of Whales, a member of the royal family and the first wife of King Charles III. She died at the age of 31. (Ballhaus L., 2023) 
⦁	Vincent Van Gogh, a Dutch post-impressionist painter, known for his paintings, The Stary Night, Sunflowers, and the Potato Eaters. He died at the age 37. (Gloria Lotha, 2023) 
⦁	Chadwick Boseman, an American actor, known for his role in Marvel’s Black Panther. He died at the age 43. (Biography.com Editors, 2021) 
⦁	John F. Kennedy, the 35th president of the United States, and the youngest president to be assassinated. He died at the age of 46. (Biography.com Editor, 2023) 
⦁	Michael Jackson, known as the King of pop, is the world’s most iconic musician of the 20th century. He died at the age of 50. (Ayanna Bailey, 2021) 
⦁	Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States. He died at the age of 56. (BBC, 2014) 
⦁	Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th president of the United States, as well as the youngest recorded American president in the nation’s history. He died at the age of 60. (History.com Editors, 2009) 
⦁	Akira Toriyama, a Japanese manga artist and character designer. Known for his creation of Dragon Ball. He died at the age of 68. (East Coast Radio, 2024) 
⦁	Louis Vuitton, a French fashion designer and businessperson, as well as the founder of the now popular brand. He died at the age of 70. (Vogue, 2012) 
⦁	 Albert Einstein, a German-born theoretical physicist. Known for developing the theory of relativity and his assistance in quantum mechanics. (Elizabeth Howell, Ailsa Harvy, 2022) 
⦁	P. T. Barnum, an American showman, businessperson, and politician. He is the founder of the famous Barnum and Bailey Circus. He died at the age of 80. (Marianne Plasse, 2023) 
⦁	Dr. Seuss, an American children’s author, and cartoonist. Famously known for his books, The Cat in The Hat, The Lorax, and How the Grinch stole Christmas. He died at the age of 87. (Marilyn La ⦁	Jeunesse , 2023) 
⦁	Pablo Picasso, a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramist, and theater designer. He made a significant impact on the influence of art in the 20th century. He died at the age of 91. (Howard Halle, 2023) 
⦁	Queen Elizabeth II, former Queen of the United Kingdom. Her reign for over 70 years is the longest of any British Monarch. She died at the age of 96. (⦁	Biography.Com Editors, ⦁	Adrienne ⦁	Donica⦁	, 2023) 
 
When I first designed my user interface, I intended to make it look like a vintage scroll, and while I liked the way it looked, I decided to change it and make the background a museum. I chose a museum since it is what comes to mind when I think about history. My background image is a museum, which makes sense considering museums are buildings or sites that house and store historic and important artifacts such as art, cultural representations, and historical events. 
Considering I am creating a history application about historical famous icons, the image is valid. My overall colour theme is brown, as I also think of the colour when I think of history. 
 
 
In terms of the project's coding, I learned there are multiple ways to generate the age. Some would use arrays, while others would use if-else statements; while I am completely competent of performing both, I preferred if-else statements. I used each statement to fill in the age range and person assigned to them. Regarding the reset/clear button, I wanted to ensure that there were no mistakes between running and entering each input, so instead of just having a general clear button, I wrote a private class that resets the entire application with a single click of the button. 
The application works by allowing you to enter an age in the supplied EditText Box and then press the create button. From there, your input will be processed through a series of if statements to determine which range it falls within. Once it has identified the correct range, it will display the assigned individual in the TextView at the bottom of the display page. If you click the button without giving your age, the application will display a notice asking you to input your age. The same would apply if you added any strings or characters to your input. If you enter a number from twenty down to one hundred up, you will also receive a pop-up message instructing you to enter a number within the specified range. 
 


 

 


 

 

Conclusion: 
In conclusion, we can state that this application is both informative and visually appealing to students, making it appropriate for them. The application teaches pupils about historical personalities of various times, as well as what they did to become famous or what impact they had on the world. 
We can also observe that the application works properly, with no strange or suspicious failures, and that each line has a distinct remark to explain the portion of code on that line.
